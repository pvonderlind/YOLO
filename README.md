# YOLO

My PyTorch implementation of the YOLO family of algorithms following the publications of Joseph Redmon and others.
Currently implemented are:
* ![YOLO_V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) [Redmon et.al, 2015]
* YOLO_V2/3 ... work in progress

My motivation behind this project was to get a better understanding of how the loss function for the YOLO family of 
algorithm is designed and how they can be implemented in PyTorch efficiently.

## Datasets

For training, the 8- and 100-example versions of the COCO dataset, which is also used in YOLO_V1.
